## 🚀 Features

- [Router](https://pub.dev/packages/go_router) for navigation. It's used to manage the routes and navigation.
- [Service Locator](https://pub.dev/packages/get_it) for dependency injection. It's used to manage the services and repositories.
- [Provider Store](https://pub.dev/packages/provider) a MultiBlocProvider that wraps the entire app for state management of the UI.
- [Shared Preferences Service](https://pub.dev/packages/shared_preferences) for local storage. It's used to manage the local storage.
- [Configuration Service]() A internal service for managing the build configuration. It's used to manage the environment variables.
- [Theme Service]() for managing the app theme.
- [Internationalization (i10n)](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/accessibility-and-localization/internationalization) support.
- [Logger]() Custom logger for debugging (Also observes the blocs).
- [Device Info]() Class for getting the device info per platform.
- [Flavors]() configuration for environments: development, staging and production. (IOS, Android and Web)
- [Husky](https://pub.dev/packages/husky) for pre-commit and pre-push hooks. (Lint, Format, Tests)
- [App Bootstrap]() function for initializing the app that applies to all flavors.
- [Build Runner]() using json_serializable and freezed for generating the models and services.
- [Flutter Lint](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_lints) for code analysis.

## 📝 Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. Active the husky hooks: (Needs to be done only once after cloning)

   ```bash
   dart run husky install
   ```

4. Execute the build runner to generate the models and services:

   ```bash
   flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
   ```

## 🏃‍♂️ Running the app

You can run the app in two ways:

### 1. VSCode

> The build runner is executed automatically when you make a hot restart by a preLaunchTask in the launch.json file. (Only for development)

The three launch configurations are:

- Development
- Staging
- Production

You can change the configuration in the launch.json file.

### 2. Console

> For the auto generate files, you must run the build runner manually
> You should run this anytime you make a change in the models or services.

```bash
flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

#### Development

```bash
flutter run --flavor development --target lib/main_development.dart
```

#### Staging

```bash
flutter run --flavor staging --target lib/main_staging.dart
```

#### Production

```bash
flutter run --flavor production --target lib/main_production.dart --release
```

## 🧪 Running Tests

To run the unit tests use the following command:

```bash
$ flutter test --coverage --test-randomize-ordering-seed random
```

To view the generated coverage report you can use [lcov](https://github.com/linux-test-project/lcov).

```bash
# Generate Coverage Report
$ genhtml coverage/lcov.info -o coverage/

# Open Coverage Report
$ open coverage/index.html
```

## 🌐 Working with Translations

This project relies on [flutter_localizations]() and follows the [official internationalization guide for Flutter]().

### Adding Strings

1. To add a new localizable string, open the `app_en.arb` file at `lib/l10n/arb/app_en.arb`.

```arb
{
    "@@locale": "en",
    "appName": "Template App",
    "@appName": {
        "description": "App Name"
    }
}
```

2. Then add a new key/value and description

```arb
{
    "@@locale": "en",
    "appName": "Template App",
    "@appName": {
        "description": "App Name"
    }
    "helloWorld": "Hello World",
    "@helloWorld": {
       "description": "Hello World"
    }
}
```

3. Use the new string

```dart
import 'package:flutter_app_empty_template/l10n/l10n.dart';

@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  final l10n = context.l10n;
  return Text(l10n.helloWorld);
}
```

### Adding Supported Locales

Update the `CFBundleLocalizations` array in the `Info.plist` at `ios/Runner/Info.plist` to include the new locale. (IOS)

```xml
    ...

    <key>CFBundleLocalizations</key>
	<array>
		<string>en</string>
		<string>es</string>
	</array>

    ...
```

### Adding Translations

1. For each supported locale, add a new ARB file in `lib/l10n/arb`.

```
├── l10n
│   ├── arb
│   │   ├── app_en.arb
│   │   └── app_es.arb
```

2. Add the translated strings to each `.arb` file:

`app_en.arb`

```arb
{
    "@@locale": "en",
    "appName": "Template App",
    "@appName": {
        "description": "App Name"
    }
}
```

`app_es.arb`

```arb
{
    "@@locale": "es",
    "appName": "Plantilla de App",
    "@appName": {
       "description": "Nombre de la App"
    }
}
```
